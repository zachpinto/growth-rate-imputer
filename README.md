#### Description:

The Growth Rate Data Imputation Tool is designed to handle datasets with missing values by using implied or artificial linear growth rates. 

This tool allows users to upload their data files in CSV or XLSX formats through a user-friendly interface called Streamlit.
Users can also opt to use a demo file for testing purposes.

The main functionality of the tool is to impute missing values in a dataset by calculating the growth rate between known data points and applying this rate to fill in the gaps.
Once the data is uploaded, the tool provides options for selecting the columns that represent the start and end years for the imputation process. 
It also offers a method to handle undefined growth rates, allowing users to choose between averaging all rows or averaging rows within shared categories. 

The imputed data is displayed for review and can be downloaded as a CSV file.
